# Run tasks

Console applications are used most of the times for performing tasks and giving output
of the result of task is important to the end-user. With Laravel Zero, you can use
the `task` method to return a result from the task code:
```php
$this->task("Installing Laravel", function () {
    return true;
});

$this->task("Doing something else", function () {
    return false;
});
```

The code above will output the following result:

    class="md:w-4/5 md:mx-auto"
