# Contributing

Everything that we make is 100% open source and developed collaboratively by people from all over the world. Even if you're not a programmer, you can get involved and make a difference.

#### Code

You may propose new features or improvements of existing Laravel Zero behavior. If you propose a new feature, please be willing to implement at least some of the code that would be needed to complete the feature.

The Laravel Zero source code is managed on GitHub, and there are repositories for each of the Laravel Zero projects:

- [Laravel Zero Application](https://github.com/laravel-zero/laravel-zero)
- [Laravel Zero Framework](https://github.com/laravel-zero/framework)
- [Laravel Zero Installer](https://github.com/laravel-zero/installer)
- [Laravel Zero Website](https://github.com/laravel-zero/website)
- [Collision](https://github.com/nunomaduro/collision)

All the contribution guidelines are mentioned [here](https://github.com/laravel-zero/laravel-zero/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Funding

My name is Nuno Maduro and I am the creator and maintainer of tools such as Laravel Zero, Collision, etc.

All my work has always been released under the Open Source license MIT, and this will continue into the far future. It has cost me thousands of hours to develop, test and support Laravel Zero, Collision, etc.

If you find the work I do for the PHP community valuable then you can show your appreciation by supporting me here on Patreon or Paypal.

The support will be used to create new features and everything related to make the console development the most enjoyable as possible.
